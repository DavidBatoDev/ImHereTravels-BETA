      question: 'How do the monthly payment plans work?',
      answer: 'You can split your trip cost into 6-24 monthly payments with competitive rates. Simply choose your preferred term during booking, and we\'ll handle the rest. No hidden fees, just transparent pricing.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a credit check required?',
      answer: 'We perform a soft credit check that won\'t affect your credit score. This helps us offer you the best payment terms available. Most travelers are approved instantly.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if I need to cancel my trip?',
      answer: 'We understand plans change. You can cancel up to 48 hours before departure with our flexible cancellation policy. Refunds are processed according to our terms, and any remaining payments are adjusted accordingly.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Are there any additional fees?',
      answer: 'We believe in transparent pricing. The only additional cost is a small financing fee (typically 3-8% APR) spread across your payment term. No hidden charges, no surprises.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I pay off my trip early?',
      answer: 'Absolutely! You can pay off your remaining balance at any time with no early payment penalties. This can also reduce your total interest paid.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What if I miss a payment?',
      answer: 'We\'ll send you friendly reminders before any payment is due. If you miss a payment, contact our support team immediately. We offer grace periods and can work with you to adjust your payment schedule.'
